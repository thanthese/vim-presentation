# What is Vi/Vim?

A text navigation and manipulation program (espcially suited for programmers).

# History

- vi created in 1976 by Bill Joy
- vim created in 1991 by Bram Moolenaar
- qed -> ed -> ex -> vim

  - ( ed -> sed -> perl -> *everywhere* )
  - ( ed -> grep )

# Improvements of vim over vi

- Completion
- Diff
- Integrated help system
- Extended regular expressions
- Scripting languages (vimscript, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, scheme, etc.)
- Mouse interaction

#

- Folding
- Editing of compressed files in gzip, bzip2, zip, and tar format
- Editing files over network protocols such as SSH, FTP, and HTTP
- Session state preservation
- Spell checking
- Split windows (horizontal and vertical)

#
- Tabbed windows
- Unicode and other multi-language support
- Syntax highlighting
- Cursor position histories
- Multiple level undo/redo history
- And visual mode

# Why should you learn vim?

- To nagivate and manipulate text quickly (80% of what we do)
- To take control of your editor (with scripting)
- To have a light-weight alternative to netbeans
- To learn a ubiquitous editor
- To master your tools
- Cool factor
- Fun (like playing a video game)

# Who should not use vim?

- Those who don't work with text
- Those who don't touch type

# But I heart NetBeans/Eclipse/Visual Studio

 Plugins or bindings are available

- NetBeans ([jvi](http://jvi.sourceforge.net/))
- Eclipse ([vrapper](http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/))
- VisualStudio
- Bash

#

- Firefox ([vimerper](http://vimperator.org/vimperator), [pentadactyl](http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/index))
- Gmail
- Word
- Lynx
- Less

# But it's hard to learn

Not so

- Different, not hard
- Learn it incrementally
- Learn a plugin in your current editor

# Tips

- Remap caps lock to escape (or use alternate escapes)
- Use the old terminology, e.g. put/yank
- Don't use mouse or arrows (use hjkl)
- Give it a week
- :h :w :q :wq :wq!

# What makes vim so great?

1. Modal
2. Interaction with unix tools
3. Customization/scripting

# What does "modal" mean?

Keyboard behaves differently in different modes.

# Why is modal good?

- Huge number of available commands, without ctrl/alt/meta
- Your hands never leave homerow
- A grammar for text manipulation

# Huge gamepad

![Gamepad!](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif "Gamepad!")

# Commonly used modes

- Normal (90% of time)
- Insert (toxic, don't stay)
- Visual
- Command

# Examples

On to the examples!

1. Modal (naviation, motions, "grammar")
2. Interaction with unix tools
3. Customization/scripting
